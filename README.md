## Installation
Run >npm i to ensure all required packages are available.  Then run >node server.js to start the application.
I have enhanced the server.js file to initialize and seed the database, then start the server to listen on port 3001.

## Links to Screencast
There are two links as the last segment had an error, which was rectified.
